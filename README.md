We build a google sheet which can automatically track all owned assets; stocks(HKEX, NASDAQ, SET, etc.), cryptocurrencies, mutual funds etc. to provide insight into historical dynamic wealth position and real-time dashboard for better financial decision making

**for stocks in HKEX, NASDAQ & Cryptocurrencies - we use GooglefinanceAPI to fetch data **
**for stocks in SET & Mutual funds - we use Web scraping to fetch data **
